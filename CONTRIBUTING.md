## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme used is: X.Y.Z where X is incremented when a new class is
   introduced (when this happens Y and Z goes back to 0), Y increments when there is a new feature on the already
   defined classes (when this happens Z goes back to 0) and Z increments when minor fixes are made.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have approval to do so.
